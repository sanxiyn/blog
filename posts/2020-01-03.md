## Survey of tiered compilation in JIT implementations

Tiered compilation is a technique used by JIT compilers to improve startup behavior. It was introduced in Java SE 7 (released in 2011), and [Java HotSpot Virtual Machine Performance Enhancements](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/vm/performance-enhancements-7.html#tieredcompilation) gives a short explanation. Note that it is enabled by default since Java SE 8 (released in 2014), so `-XX:+TieredCompilation` is no longer necessary.

In this post, I will compare implementations of tiered compilation in JIT compilers implementing Java, .NET, and JavaScript. It would be desirable to extend the survey to include [LuaJIT](http://luajit.org/), [PyPy](http://pypy.org/), and [HHVM](https://hhvm.com/), but my time and knowledge is limited. Maybe next time. If you can help me on those implementations or other JIT compilers, don't hesitate to let me know.

I hope to keep this up-to-date, but there will be inevitable delay, and code and documentation on this topic change often and move often. So don't be surprised if some links are broken, and please report them. To counter this, I will include titles of documentations or variable names in codes that can be of help to re-locate the information.

### Java

I will look at [HotSpot](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk). The repository contains entire Java system, which is called OpenJDK. VM part is called HotSpot, and located under `src/hotspot`. The rest is libraries.

[GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/) is another interesting system I would like to investigate. Help is appreciated.

Apart from the documentation mentioned above, HotSpot's tiering is reasonably documented by a long comment in [tieredThresholdPolicy.hpp](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/master/src/hotspot/share/compiler/tieredThresholdPolicy.hpp). Either you need given number of calls, or minimal number of calls plus given number of calls and loops.

Actual values are defined in [globals.hpp](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/master/src/hotspot/share/runtime/globals.hpp). Look for `*InvocationThreshold*`, `*MinInvocationThreshold*`, `*CompileThreshold*`, and `*BackEdgeThreshold*`. Their meanings are explained in the comment referred above.

### .NET

I will look at [CoreCLR](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime). The repository contains entire .NET system, which is called .NET Core. VM part is called CoreCLR, and located under `src/coreclr`. The rest is libraries.

[Mono](https://www.mono-project.com/) is another interesting system. After the first version of this post was published, [@lewurm](https://github.com/lewurm) pointed me to his own PR implementing [tiered compilation in Mono](https://github.com/mono/mono/pull/17551) (2019). Thanks!

.NET didn't have tiered compilation for a long time. When it got implemented in 2016, a design document titled [Tiered Compilation](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/design/features/tiered-compilation.md) was written. It was released in 2.1 and enabled by default in 2.2, both in 2018.

Note that links to implementation in the design document is outdated. The policy is implemented in `MethodDesc::DetermineAndSetIsEligibleForTieredCompilation` in `method.cpp`, for example. 

Actual values are defined in [clrconfigvalues.h](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/src/coreclr/src/inc/clrconfigvalues.h). Look for `TC_*`. `TC_CallCountThreshold` is set to 30.

### JavaScript

Among JIT implementations of JavaScript, I will look at [V8](https://v8.dev/), [JavaScriptCore](https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/JavaScriptCore), and [SpiderMonkey](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey).

[ChakraCore](https://github.com/microsoft/ChakraCore) is another interesting implementation: if you know about it, please tell me.

V8's tiering is controlled by [runtime-profiler.cc](https://github.com/v8/v8/blob/master/src/execution/runtime-profiler.cc). Unlike other JIT compilers, V8 does not count calls or loops. Instead, stack is periodically sampled and when functions are seen some number of times in stack, they are marked for optimization. Threshold is increased for larger functions.

JavaScriptCore's options are defined in [OptionsList.h](https://github.com/WebKit/webkit/blob/master/Source/JavaScriptCore/runtime/OptionsList.h). Look for `thresholdFor*` variables and `*IncrementFor*` variables. Functions start in interpreter. Calls are counted as 15, and one loop iteration is counted as 1. When counter reaches 100 (about 6 calls), baseline JIT is used. When counter reaches 1000 (about 60 calls), DFG JIT is used. WebAssembly functions have separate tiers.

Note that values for FTL JIT do not match explanation in WebKit wiki; of course, code is correct and wiki is outdated.

SpiderMonkey's JIT options are defined in [JitOptions.cpp](https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev/blob/master/js/src/jit/JitOptions.cpp). Look for `*WarmUpThreshold`. Functions start in interpreter. Calls and loops are counted. When counter reaches 10, baseline interpreter is used. When counter reaches 100, baseline compiler is used. When counter reaches 1000, Ion compiler is used with normal optimization level. When counter reaches 100000, Ion compiler is used with full optimization level.

SpiderMonkey's baseline interpreter is not same as interpreter. If that sounds weird, you are not alone. [The Baseline Interpreter: a faster JS interpreter in Firefox 70](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/08/the-baseline-interpreter-a-faster-js-interpreter-in-firefox-70/) explains what's going on in detail.
